# eBPF ROS - telemetry instrumentation for ROS2 applications

This work aims at providing an eBPF based telemetry instrumentation leveraging eBPF and exporting telemetry in the OpenTelemetry standard.

## Building and running the project

Run 'make clean' to clean up already compiled artefacts
Run 'make' to compile the ebpf programs and build the go userspace program
Run 'sudo -E ./ebpf-ros' to launch the program. Superuser permissions are needed to load the program in the kernel, and the -E flag is used to preserve the user space environment variables used for the OTeL exporter. This is suboptimal and should be changed if possible

# TODO
- [] Figure out why performance event go struct is not generated by ebpf2go
- [] Figure out why the data_t struct is not generated by ebpf2go
